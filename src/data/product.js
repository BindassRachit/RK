A dry scrubber works by combining carefully chosen chemical reagents with the exhaust stream at incredibly high speeds, that react with or absorb the compounds in the stream. These chemicals react differently, depending on which compounds are being targeted; reactions either neutralize the dangerous VOCs, or absorb them into a different compound all-together. Once converted, the substance left over can then be disposed of or transported easily. Each type of scrubber media removes particles and compounds in a different way; some chemical reactions, while others use electrostatic adhesion."
